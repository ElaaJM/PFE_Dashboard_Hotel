999812067,"I am extremely disappointed with the reception staff.
I have repeatedly asked to change rooms and each time the same answer tomorrow but nothing happens. And in addition to that, more than limited kindness.
A hotel calling for 4 stars is rather like a hotel with 4 shooting stars.
To flee !!!",Neutral
995421868,"Perfect welcome, very caring kind staff. I appreciated the large hearty buffet, with European and Tunisian specialties.

Great experiance and for sure to be recommended for future seminars.,",Positive

969342422,"Simply shameful. Room full of ants, yellow stained sheets, mold on the walls, dirt and hair everywhere. Terrace communicating with the terraces of the other rooms, pity, however, that I could not close the balcony and that anyone could have entered and steal everything. Escape !!!!",Neutral
968950659,"For asmathics like me, I do not recommend this hotel. It has the distinction of having carpets in the rooms and what is more systematically cleaned. Especially since the hotel does not have non -smoking rooms (all rooms have an ashtray) ... so may have cigarette odors in some of them. In addition, the service is not worthy of a 4*: glasses offered but no water bottle which is the minimum required. To succeed in sleeping, I had to put a t-shirt on the pillow so much that he was loaded with dust. I do not recommend this hotel for the dilapidation of the rooms. Otherwise the staff try to do the necessary with the few means made available. Expensive for what it is (110 €/night in September.",Neutral
957068460,"I often go to Bizerte for work, I have tested the hotel for the first time, it is splendid from the outside, it reminds me of a palace of Marrakech, the garden and the very well maintained swimming pool. I was with a room in the 4th century, in the 4th the rooms deserve a renovation and I took a renovated room in the 1st floor, they are perfect, Italian shower marble on the ground.
The staff are very nice in the welcome, a big thank you to Rim who knows his job well and who is always looking for a solution for customers. The morning breakfast must be Ameliore, the evening buffet and very correct.
I will come back with pleasure without this hotel .... and I recommend it is surely the best of bizerte, there is also the spa to relax in the evening after work.",Positive

907621421,"Great hotel on the beach, and easy walking distance to medina. Staff excellent, and rooms of a  very good standard. Breakfast good, but no toasting machine or tea. Pool bar and restaurant very good but closes way too early around 5, which only leaves the bar for a drink, which is very dated, and the most uncomfortable chairs, I have ever experienced, although bar staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms cleaned to a high standard, and can recommend the sea view ones, excellent. Shoe shine machines on each floor, but non have any polish in them, just the Rotating brushes. Bathrooms to a high standard, but no plugs in the sink, so not ideal. Air conditioning not very cold. Overall a very good experience, and the beach is superb.",Positive
900942881,"Hello, this hotel absolutely does not deserve 4 stars. Very old hotel. The cleanliness of the rooms leaves something to be desired. The bed linen has not been changed. Corpse of a bird in the terrace that has apparently dated for a long time. Our booking agency had to ring at the reception so that we can change rooms. Our opinion remained the same.

867321283,"First stay in this hotel, I am very disappointed with the reception woman, very cold with customers, not to smile, I ask to have a sea viewed room she refuses on the pretext that the hotel is complete when it is very empty.  During the welcome we are waiting for more than an hour to have the keys to the room, not even a glass of water to offer us. We arrive in the room there is just a bath for a single person while we are a couples with a baby. I can't find a baby bed in the bedroom, so I kindly decent at the reception to ask for the baby bed, she replies that it will come dici tonight ... And she also tells me that I can make a complaint in case I do not receive the baby bed with a poorly polished look.
At the end of the stay I make the keys not even a word or a look. Frankly, she does not deserve the place of the reception.
Very average breakfast. Dirty table. 
Clean room but too much noise at night in the corridors and a lot of street noise ...
I do not recommend this hotel, unfortunately there are not much choice in Bizerte.",Neutral

599223375,"We booked a triple room. When we got there, an extra bed was in place but with no sheets and only one big towel for the 3 of us. We told the reception but then had to remind them a further 2 times for anything to get done. When the sheets finally arrived, they handed them to us and left. They didn't even try to make the bed. 

In the morning, when we woke up, our bags were covered in ants. We dusted the ants off and when we told the reception, they just asked us why we didn't tell them earlier because we could have switched rooms. We told them that there were only 1-2 ants around the room the previous night (which we thought was normal for a warm country - so we didn't think to mention it)Then they suggested that it could have been our fault if we were carrying food (we weren't).

If it had been one of the above issues, it would have been alright but combined, it was a terrible experience. We asked for a refund. They offered us half the money back, on the condition that we don't write any negative reviews online! Unbelievable!",Neutral

566507907,"Home -> OK
Chambers State -> Middle. They would need to be renovated, some sockets did not work, the wire of the extra lamp was defective, etc.
Cleanliness -> The establishment being a little aging it is difficult to make a real opinion on this point.

Price: very correct for one night",Positive
546939138,"At first glance, the Bizerta Resort seems ok. The reception area, the grounds outside, the beach access, the nice outdoors pool and the heated indoors pool all give the illusion that it's a proper hotel. Even the rooms are spacious. But that is where the positive aspects end. The sink does not drain, the toilet does not flush, the bathroom is depressing, the food is terrible, the breakfast is basic and service is virtually absent. If you've got an ocean view room, make sure you're on the third floor otherwise you risk seeing more concrete structures than ocean from the balcony.

We were there for a conference and the meeting room was nicely located and very well heated. But it's not a place where I would choose to come for a holiday, as you spend most of your time stressing because the basics don't work.",Positive

Air conditioning automatically climbs that we leave the room, as a result when you go back in the middle of the day the atmosphere is stifling and unbearable 
Nice international TV bouquet but no list of channels available
Sad and uninteresting breakfast buffet 

The bedding is low -end and is not up to the standing of the hotel and the selling prices charged

Point to improve:
The carpet in the rooms deserves to be thoroughly deserves or replacement. The chamber air conditioner deserves a small gas recharge to be more effective. The parking lot is not closed by a fence and gate. Bedding and decoration deserve a makeover. (80s and 90s).

370610733,"We stayed there for two nights. The place looks overall ok, like a true resort. We payed 110 euros per night (55 euros per person, not sure why they count per person...). Quite a sum for Tunisia and from there one is tempted to judge everything based on rather high standards. And that s when one gets often disappointed, though not always. The room was nice with sea view and lots of light. Hotel itself looks old, like it hasn't been maintained since the 80s. One can feel that these are hard times for tourism and that money is scarce. Hotel seems understaffed. Staff are very nice, though better service would be expected for this kind of hotel. Alcohol is served and the bar looks old and empty and atmosphere rather sad. Two swimming pools - outdoor and indoor - though outdoor was not open yet. Outside the badly needs maintenance.  Breakfast was included but was simply of  horrible quality. Internet worked bad.  So overall OK but not worth the price really.",Neutral

They were endowed with a spa, but it was practically in the most absolute degradation, we went to have dinner in the restaurant and there was a gentleman who did both waitresses and chefs, food (if we want to call him such) seemed a pulp or food for animals.

And even if these rooms overlook the street they are not noisy it is well isolated.
The indoor swimming pool is often full because they are accessible even to non -residents.

Despite the cancellation of the last minute of one of the reserved rooms, I was not paid for anything also like I had a very small baby with me, I was given access to the room two hours before check in. Always with a smile in addition.
The good impression I had when I arrived lasted the whole stay or maid, carrier, server at the restaurant or the snake bar, all were of impeccable professionalism and very kindness and flexibility. This professionalism and kindness make you forget some brands of old age that the hotel is starting to take which is starting to need a little new stroke.
Dinner and breakfast food is diversified and good (especially pastry) however not quite worthy of a five -star but rather four stars. However, everyone always ends up finding a dish for their taste.

Too bad the promised free Wi-Fi with very low field and which often does not work from 20:00 on the next morning. Given the costs of calls from Tunisia to Italy (€ 3.00 minutes with Vodafone) is a heavy lack.

We booked with booking.com and the hotel refused to honour the price we booked at. The lady cashier argued for 20 minutes, at check out, before giving up and was bad tempered throughout. She was good at arguing in English though.

The rooms are very spacious, nicely decorated, tastefully, and very well equipped, including with the WiFi throughout the hotel including the rooms. For those who like to watch television, the hotel offers a large amount of Arab, international and French channels like France 2, TF1, M6 etc.
The women of rooms are also very friendly and provide a very cleaning service, always with a smile. The bathroom benefits from all modern equipment and in perfect condition.
Well air conditioned, the room also has a very suitable balcony of dimension.
Overall, the staff are not stingy with information and puts themselves at your entire disposal to satisfy you.
For having tested it for several days, the buffet breakfast offers a significant choice of breads, pastries and cakes; Three kinds of cheeses are offered next to hot dishes including eggs and Tunisian specialties. Good choice of yogurts also and fresh seasonal fruit.
This hotel is an excellent price ratio price. I can easily testify, I who travel around the world as a journalist. Advertising announces it as a business hotel. Admittedly, but it can also be very suitable for a pleasant family vacation. The swimming pool is of beautiful dimension and the lifeguard very kind. You can eat in summer at the snack near the swimming pool for those who love idleness all day.
A spa is also announced, I did not have the leisure to test it but it seems completely suitable.
Another significant point, the hotel is well located in Bizerte, equidistence of the port, the city center and the cornice.

39907396,"Bizerta Resort Hotel, luxury product in Tunisia, on the edge of a wide golden sandy beach ... In summer, a lively seaside hotel offering various entertainment such as ""Cabaret Show, Bingo, Billards"" ... without forgetting the theme evenings ""folk evening, varieties' shows. This is as described in its brochure, this most ""prestigious"" hotel in the region. By ""L'Obor Lécés"" we offered ourselves a few weeks in this dream ""Eldorado"". But, like the crow, we let ourselves be taken by the fox. The wide golden sandy beach is only a huge bin in reality in which blooms, pells mix, plastic bags, used layers, empty cans and ... all kinds of nor fine nor gold. The seaside animation is ensured, during the day by the intrusion, at the swimming pool, every afternoon of young people emanating from the cities of the Parisian suburbs which, for subsidies are authorized to use the services of the swimming pool and the adjoining snack bar, with the sale of alcohol, making the place infrequent for the residents of the hotel. If this same place is not ""public"" in the morning, it is, however, difficult to find a deckchair whose mattress is not dirty or sticky, the result of their battles with cola coca or other beverages. The hotel thus proves its disinterest in the well -being of its residents and its interest in the windfall brought by this external population. As for night animations, we did not have enough to look for. Maybe it is, this unfortunate musician installed, away, by a deserted swimming pool and who drives ... nothing? Point of ""bingo, variety show"". On the other hand, the hotel still in search of income, welcomes almost daily weddings which, around 10 p.m. you ""delight"" from their ""you you"" to the sound of drums. Which, if you are lucky, will let you fall asleep around 1 a.m. But maybe a part of billiards would make you happy? Well no! Failed! Both are broken. Damage. Failed evening. Because the city like the hotel has nothing to offer in the evening. Are we going to be able to console ourselves in front of a good table? Again ... disappointment. At breakfast, in the form of a buffet, you will find fruit juices cut off from water, hard bread, hard eggs and some local cold meats. It is not he who will make you fat. So let's go to lunch at the snack swimming pool where a reviewed staff ""welcomes"" you. The smile is reserved for local customers. If you plan to have lunch there for several consecutive days it is advisable to have a pronounced taste for pizzas and pasta ... Pizzas always very fine sometimes covered with Tunisian Mozzarela Rance. Fortunately there is dinner ... There it is variable, rather less bad certain evenings. Here again it is the buffet formula that wins. At the meal level in general, the specialty of the place is to try to ""turn"" you what you have not chosen. You said Vanilla-Chocolate ice cream ... Well you will eat a vanilla-spout. You ask for a ""gray from Tunisia"" rosé, it is a ""Saint Augustine"" with a double price that we bring you. And everything is amendment. In summary: you have money to waste, a furious desire to get bored, this ""prestigious"" hotel will welcome you for an unforgettable vacation. We will not talk about the coldness of the director who does not encourage comments. Rest assured, there are quality hotels in Tunisia.

Excellent welcome - polite and efficient staff - Ambia R room with large wardrobes for the joy of his wife - conditionedly silent and well -adjustable system (among the best found) - location near the center and on the beach - excellent and well -kept swimming pool - good service by the pool.
The only drawback not attributable to the hotel is the beautiful and inviting but very embarrassing beach for women in bikini: Burkini reigns sovereign
Excellent hotel also for business and meetings",Positive

Despite the various complaints made at the hotel and the various stimulates made to the managers, no solution was offered to repair the damage that was caused to me or find the exact person who damaged my vehicle and this despite the video surveillance system.

3 months after the incident no return from them.

So I decided to file a complaint in order to settle my business.
